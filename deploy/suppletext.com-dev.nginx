# nginx config file for suppletext.com (dev)
# Because we need subdomain functionality, we can't run the dev version at
# http://dev.suppletext.com. So we, instead, run it at some specified port.
# Which we decide is port 8000.

#We can't do redirect from www to without the www while keeping the port
#number. But that's fine since this is only the dev server.

# We need to duplicate this for wildcard subdomains.
